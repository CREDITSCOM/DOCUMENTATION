# CREDITS-A new generation of blockchain
### What is CREDITS?
Welcome to our source code repository! CREDITS is an open blockchain platform with autonomous smart contracts and an internal cryptocurrency with the possibility of wide scaling. 
The CREDITS platform is based on  a decentralized  peer-to-peer network. It operates through the Internet and uses the TCP/IP network model as the principal model for intra-network data and command transfer. THe high performance is provided by using the unique consensus algorithm(DPOS+BFT) and developing on C/C++ programming language. All data transfers to and from network use the UDP transport layer protocol of the network model, and high-performance NoSQL system is the storage concept employed for key-value data storage.
### The project develops the following modules for the platform:
* CS NODE
* CS Desktop wallet
* CS Web Wallet
* CS API
* CS Monitor
### Main features of CREDITS platform
* High transaction speed(1 mln transaction per second)
* Unique type of consensus(DPOS+BFT) with asynchromous work
* Low time block processing(0.5s)
* Dynamical block size
* Multi-layer logic software structure
* EDS algorithm based on ECDSA25519 technology
* Blake2b hashcoding
* Asynchronous data processing
* Multi-platform software
* Unique UDP-based bounded-buffer transport protocol
* LevelDB NoSQL storage
* Snappy data compression algorithm
* Built-in programming language for smart contracts in Java
* Cycles and schedules in smart contracts
* Integration with external services using andvanced API

### Developing tools
The platform is designed to create services for blockchain systems with high security performance and built decentralized applications for IOT and financial sphere and provides the following tools for developers:
* Advanced API
* SDK with supporting JVM(JAVA MACHINE)
