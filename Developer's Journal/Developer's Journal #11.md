Before a full-fledged commercial release, CREDITS will undergo the stages of closed and open pre-release platform testing. The aim is to check its functionality and robustness.

“Today, on May 11, we’re launching closed pre-release testing. Many thanks to all of the community members who applied to participate in the process and become our testers!” Eugeniy Butyaev, CTO & Co-Founder at CREDITS, says with a sense of appreciation. “We’ve reviewed hundreds requests and selected people located across the globe with high level expertise. They’ll be added to a dedicated Telegram group to get started together with the project team.”
We’ve created CREDITS Monitor, a page dedicated to testing. We’ve optimized the CREDITS node software by adding full-fledged synchronization and a fully functional consensus based on the DPoS+BFT algorithm. For more information, please click here.

We’d like to inform all our community regarding possible hard reboots of servers and work processes in the period between closed and open testing stages. We also might change, modify or delete some of the functions over the course of testing for debugging and improvement purposes.
