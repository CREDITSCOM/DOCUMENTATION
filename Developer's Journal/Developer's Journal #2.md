# CREDITS Alpha version achieved 100 thousand TPS
“The most exciting event of the week was the virtual burning of 750 528 928,79 tokens, which were unsold during the ICO ,” Valentin Antonov, team leader at CREDITS shares his impressions. “The tokens stored in the contributors’ wallets were unblocked and became transferable. Token trading started on Tidex, IDEX and Ether Delta exchanges. The tokens owned by the founders of our project, were frozen for a year to cover future operating expenses. The exchange of PRE-ICO tokens to ICO tokens has begun and this process is continuing.”

The development of the support portal has begun, and the development of the main website sections is ongoing. Among our priorities is an ongoing optimization of the core! The synchronization of the database between the nodes has been configured, and bots have started to test the platform performance.

Smart contracts are another important area of ​​work. We have simplified the code for the custom java class. For example, we have added an error search system, and implemented a pool of java-application connections to increase performance. Also we have highlighted the syntax of the user code. We are now building a tree of custom java class elements.

In addition, we would like to mention work progress on support: we already have a telegram bot for general chat, and have solved the problem with transactions caused by incorrect gas input. We recommend putting 10 GWEI 250 000 gas.

Finally, some very important information from our testing and analytics department about the next Alpha version updates. Yandex metrics are connected to the Monitor. The design of the web service has been improved. We have added new cases for 4 test kits: creation of wallets / entry into existing wallets (19 test cases), exchange of currency and valuables (15 cases), balance check (12 cases), check transaction history (9 cases).

A great work has already been done by our team, as a result the Alpha version of the CREDITS platform is already capable of 100,000 transactions per second. Every second, special robots load a huge number of requests into the system to test its performance.

Eugeniy Butyaev CTO & Co-Founder sums up the week , “We invite everyone to take part in this testing, to create wallets, and check the speed. With your help we can make our innovative project even better and more reliable.”
