# Our development team headed by СТО Eugeniy Butyaev reports weekly on the work done.

“The main task for this week was removing the errors of our transaction scanner monitor.credits.com!” Eugeniy says. “We have solved the problems of page-by-page viewing. Search button is active now too. Next point of the agenda is the code refactoring — uniting common parts into components.”
The E-wallet issue has taken no less time. There used to be duplicate lines and delay on the transaction display, errors in the entering the E-Wallet and the possibility of transferring at zero balance. All of these errors are eliminated. In addition, we added a public-key format check.

The functional Alpha testing is now on. 20 test-cases have been formed for fixing the operability of its various functions like e-wallet creation/enter, currency and assets exchange, balance check, transaction history check etc.

A routine work is still there as well.

“Every day we check our website and make sure all the sections are in their places, texts do not to shift, links are active. We do it for every language: Hindi, Korean, Japanese etc. We do not forget anyone from our world community,” says Valentin Antonov — the main project architect.
Above all — IP-core work’s optimization: added the pool counters, corrected memory leaks’ and round algorithms’ errors. Digital signature’s function library is now developed with ECDSA25519 technology.

CREDITS aim is to make the platform as available as possible. This is the reason why we focus so much attention on the support. The team develops the models of it, as well as installation and using manuals for Alpha-version, pre-ICO token exchange manual and adding ERC20 tokens into users’ e-wallets manual. We check the platform regularly, and transmit all the data about small or critical errors to the team of developers online without delays.

“The goal is to make the CREDITS a functional, stable and reliable platform for all our users,” resumes Eugeniy.
Please follow CREDITS news updates. All together, we make our innovative project better and more secure.
