# Error correction.
Let us start our Diary by expressing our gratitude and apologizing.

“I’d like to thank everybody who helps us test our platform. Together we’ll make the CREDITS project even better, more reliable, and faster. Last week, we corrected a lot of bugs, many of them were found by our users. Thank you once again our community!” says Eugeniy Butyaev, CTO & Co-Founder at CREDITS.

We’ll certainly host a live-stream Q&A session to answer all of your questions. Broadcasting was scheduled for April 9 but we had to postpone it due to technical issues with video equipment. We’re really sorry. Meanwhile, you’re all invited to watch this video with answers to frequently asked questions and constructive feedback .

The team of developers has corrected three errors related to the execution of transactions. They can no longer be sent to an invalid wallet or executed without confirmation, and transaction details activated by the “view transaction detail” button are now displayed fully. Visual corrections have been made, too. Buttons no longer get in the way of page numbers in the transaction history.

“Considerable changes have been made to the platform kernel. These primarily include network synchronization mechanisms: we’ve added pooling time and pool hash to the transaction transmission packet. We’ve corrected the keepAlive mechanism, debugged the generation of a datagram with the largest possible number of transactions, optimized the kernel code. We’ve changed the encoding, +/= b and other symbols can no longer be found in either public or private keys,” Eugeniy says.

Apart from bug fixing, developers continued improving the functionality of the desktop wallet. Balance update button is now in place. Keys are now available to save to, and download from, a selected file.
