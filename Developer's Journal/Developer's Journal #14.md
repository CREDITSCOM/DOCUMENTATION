# Update on the current status of CREDITS platform testing.
Thanks to our testing team and testing community issues with our software in areas of transactions validation and transport were allocated and fixed.

Consensus module was updated to provide more effective parallel transactions record process.

“During the testing-fixing phase we were focused on platform stability and speed, that is why we updated generation of valid transactions vector module and its replication between trusted nodes. Overall we implemented more than 80 changes” , says CREDITS CTO Eugeniy Butyaev
Our core applications like Wallet and Monitor were updated as well to reflect nodes changes. Now monitor has new feature that allows to switch between Test and pre-Mainnet networks.

Majority of the issues arose when our test network was extended up to 50 nodes. The numbers were achieved by building our own distributed test infrastructure. Our team created 5 node farms based on servers collocated all over Europe (Strasbourg (France), Frankfurt (Germany)). All data centres are certified by ISO 9001: 2008, ISO/IEC 27001:2005, IDW PS951.

“We will keep you updated regarding the latest status of the CREDITS platform development. Assure you we are working hard to let all our community join us in public testing and check the speed of CREDITS platform”, adds Eugeniy Butyaev.
