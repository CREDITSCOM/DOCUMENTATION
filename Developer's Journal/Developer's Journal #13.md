# Full integration test of a cold start of the NET
We are delighted to share with you a short video which shows how the testing goes in our testing environment.

It is a full integration test of a “cold start” of the NET establishing consensus, initiating, verification and synchronization of transactions and blockchain data.

This test was successful, and the CREDITS team will keep updating our community with the feedback from our test team.
